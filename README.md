### What I learned

In this project I had problem to scale icons using svgs tags in hero section. I was using them like they were provided. To solve this problem I have added viewBox attribute to svg element like this:

```html
    <svg className='w-full h-auto' width="114" height="20" viewBox='0 0 114 20' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
```

Without viewBox property it doesn't work even there was set width to match full size

### Useful resources

- [How to scale svgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clv_YhMWoFk) - this helped to properly scale svg tags. This is superb video that explains how to scale svg to parent element but also how viewBox attribute works.
